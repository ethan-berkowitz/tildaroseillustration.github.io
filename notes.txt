-set height for navbar and title so they don't "jump around" when page is loading

-can call all set elements (title, navbar, social media) in one script, but you need to
be sure to use fetch priority to make sure the elements that are higher on the page load BEFORE
the ones at the bottom because the user will SEE if they aren't loaded immediately
